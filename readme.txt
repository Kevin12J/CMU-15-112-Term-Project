Project Description:
This project is a game called Tank Battle. The goal of the game is to destroy enemy turrets and tanks and advance forward. 
Destroying enemies will reward you with points and coins. The coins can be used to purchase the power ups seen on the right. 
You canâ€™t drive backwards and any tanks missed at the bottom will result in a health deduction. 
As the levels get higher, the amount of enemy tanks will increase and the firing rate of the enemies will increase. 
After level 10 the map would begin to automatically move down. After level 20 the bullets will start to follow your tank. 
The game ends once you lose all your health.
